# Simpson's Rule Integration

## Description
This repository provides implementations of Simpson's Rule for numerical integration in various programming languages. Simpson's Rule is used to estimate the value of definite integrals by approximating the area under a curve.

### Supported Languages:
- **Java**
- **C++**
- **C**
- **Ruby**
- **R**

## How to Use
Each implementation includes a simple example of how to use Simpson's Rule to approximate integrals. Follow the instructions for the respective language to compile and run the code.

## Example
To integrate a function using Simpson's Rule, input the function, limits of integration, and number of subintervals into the program. The program will return the estimated value of the integral.
